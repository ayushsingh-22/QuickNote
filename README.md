* Persistent **system notifications** for important tasks.
* **Snooze functionality** for delaying tasks when needed.
* Reminders work fully **offline**, syncing when internet returns.

### 🔄 Offline-First Architecture

* Notes are available offline at all times.
* **Background sync** keeps data consistent across devices.
* Smart **conflict resolution** ensures no overwriting when multiple updates happen.

### 📲 Device Sync via Device ID & QR Code

* Seamlessly **sync notes across multiple devices** without requiring an account.
* Each installation generates a unique **Device ID** that can be securely shared.
* Quickly link devices by **scanning a QR code**, enabling instant pairing.
* Works fully offline-first, with background sync resuming when internet connectivity is available.
* Ensures secure, private, and anonymous syncing between your personal devices.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### 🏗️ Architecture

* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** for clear separation of concerns.
* **Repository pattern** for data handling and abstraction.
* **Coroutines** for asynchronous tasks with structured concurrency.
* **StateFlow** for real-time, reactive UI updates.
* Dependency Injection with **Hilt** (expandable for future scaling).
* **Device Sync Module** for managing unique Device IDs, QR code generation, and secure device-to-device linking.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Kotlin** — primary development language.
* **Jetpack Compose** — modern UI toolkit.
* **Room Database** — local persistence layer.
* **ML Kit** — natural language entity extraction for reminders.
* **WorkManager** — background processing and sync tasks.
* **AndroidX Libraries** — lifecycle-aware, robust components.
* **ZXing / ML Kit Barcode** — QR code generation and scanning for device linking.

### 💡 Smart AI Features

* On-device processing ensures **privacy and security** of user data.
* Recognizes natural date/time expressions like *“tomorrow at 5pm”* or *“next Monday”*.
* Handles **context-aware scenarios**, like differentiating *“Meeting at 3”* vs *“Finish report by 3”*.
* Intelligent formatting detection makes notes consistent without manual effort.
